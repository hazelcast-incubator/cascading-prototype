/**
 * Represents abstract state-machine;
 * <p/>
 * State-machines are used to provide consistency of main JET's objects and operations;
 * <p/>
 * All main operations under main objects are performed via state-machine's transition;
 * <p/>
 * For example if we ned to start container it will work like:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *      START__EVENT ->
 *      CONTAINER_STATE_MACHINE
 *              -> Execution of request processor (here we can start container)
 *              -> transition to the next state
 *              -> output
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Transition matrix lets to prevent appearance of inconsistent state, for example
 * execution of the application before DAG has been sibmit;
 *
 * @param <Input>  - input type of stateMachine's event;
 * @param <State>  - current state of the stateMachine;
 * @param <Output> - output of the stateMachine;
