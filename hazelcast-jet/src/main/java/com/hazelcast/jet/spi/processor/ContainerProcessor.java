 * Abstract JET processor for application's execution;

 * Should be implemented by user and will be used during container's execution;
 * <p/>
 * There are two phases of execution:
 * <pre>
 *      1) Read phase. When Jet reads data from all input producers (previous vertices or taps) and
 *      can write or just collect somewhere input data;
 *
 *      2) Finalization phase. When JET uses results of Read-phase (if it presents) and can write or not
 *      data to the output stream;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * There is strict happens-before relation between execution of processor's execution.
 * So no needs to use thread-safe structures in case if task created separate processor
 * using corresponding factory;
 *
 * @param <I> - Type of the input object;
 * @param <O> - Type of the output object;
